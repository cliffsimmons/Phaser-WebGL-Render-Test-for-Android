# Phaser WebGL Render Test for Android

This repository contains the web-based contents that are to be uploaded to http://cocoon.io for compilation to an Android App using Cocoon's Canvas+ feature.

## Current Problem

The files in the `project-contents-for-cocoon` directory work perfectly in a web browser. However, once that directory is compressed and uploaded to http://cocoon.io using the Canvas+ feature, the resulting .APK only shows a splash screen followed by an empty black screen. However, the result should be a black screen with a red square fading in and out (I am trying to keep the code very _very_ simple for now in order to test Phaser's WebGL performance). If anyone knows how I can get past the empty black screen problem, I would greatly appreciate the help :)
